              Will your junk removal company throw all of my stuff away?
              Not always. Some of the items are repurposed or recycled.
              
              What do I do with items that I don't want to keep but also don't want to throw away?
              For items like this, we can either donate them or recycle them!
              
              What if your trucks cannot fit in my small residential area?
              Being that we are so rural, this usually isnâ€™t a problem. If so, we have the equipment to safely get you taken care of!
              
              Do I have to do any heavy lifting myself?
              No, our highly-skilled professional team will handle all of your removal needs!
              
              What kind of junk will you remove?
              While we would love to remove everything, we can remove almost anything. We can remove all kinds of junk, except for hazardous materials (ie; paints, solvents, ect).
              
              Who will be working at my home?
              All of our employees are professionally trained in safely moving bulky items.
              
              Are you insured?
              Yes, we are fully insured.
              
              How do I book an appointment?

              Is anything too big for you to remove?
              No. Usually we can dismantle, cut up or maneuver just about anything.
              
              What type of payment do you accept?
              We accept cash, checks or Venmo style apps.
              
              What if I cannot be home during the service?

            The Grace Journey
            It is not always about the money. Paying or non-paying jobs – always do what you are doing for God and the
            rest will fall into place.

            Last week, I was contacted by an organization called The Grace Journey about an elderly gentleman (Mr.Pete)
            and his wife who needed our help.

            Due to some medical misfortunes, they were not able to maintain their property up to Victoria’s codes and
            the fines were mounting up.

            With the help of several volunteers from The Grace Journey and the All-Out Junk & Debris Removal team, we
            were able to get their place cleaned up.

            Hopefully, the City of Victoria is satisfied.

            I will continue to check in on and visit with Mr. Pete from time to time to make sure things are going in
            their favor.

            We had a great time collecting toys for the Angel tree! We want to thank those who have participated in the
            toy drive. We appreciate the donations that were received. Hopefully, this will keep the Christmas spirit
            alive in a few homes this year.

            We also want to give a special shout-out to Finders Keepers out of Victoria, Tx for hosting the Victoria
            drop-off location.

            We made our donation to the Edna Police Department’s Angel Tree and they were very happy to receive the
            blessing.

            Thanks again to everyone who participated!
